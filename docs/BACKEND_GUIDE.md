# Backend Documentation: Niti Setu

The Niti Setu backend is a robust Node.js/Express.js service designed to
orchestrate complex AI pipelines and secure data persistence.

## 🧠 AI Orchestration (RAG & Vision)

The core value of the backend lies in its **Custom Native RAG Engine**.

### RAG Pipeline Logic

1. **Groq Cloud (Llama 3.3/3.2):** We utilize Groq for ultra-fast, low-latency AI inference
   for reasoning and extracting text from user-uploaded documents (Aadhaar/7-12) as an
   ephemeral vision stream.
2. **Embedding Process:** Raw scheme PDFs are parsed and split into overlapping segments
   (1000 characters, 200 character overlap). We use the `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model
   via Transformers.js locally to generate 384-dimensional vector embeddings at zero cost.
3. **Hybrid Retrieval:** Merges Vector similarity scores and Keyword match scores.
4. **MMR Re-ranking:** Diversifies the top-k chunks to maximize the LLM's context coverage.
5. **Dual-Layer Conflict Detection:** 
   - **Hard Conflicts (Neo4j):** Intercepts explicitly defined `EXCLUSIVE_OF` business rules.
   - **Soft Conflicts (LLM Output):** Employs aggressive "Semantic Duplicate Override" prompting to reject conceptually identical scheme overlaps even if string names differ.

## 📊 Database Architecture

*   **MongoDB Atlas:** 
* Primary storage for user profiles and scheme data.
* **Vector Database:** Stores the 1000-character document chunks alongside rich metadata.
* **Vector Search Index:** Handles the `$vectorSearch` queries using cosine similarity.
* **Neo4j Aura (Free):**
  * Stores the **Scholarship/Scheme Taxonomy** as a Knowledge Graph.
  * Enforces **Mutual Exclusion** logic natively. The database seeds over 22+ explicit hard rules preventing farmers from holding cross-sector overlapping schemes (e.g. blocking PMFBY and WBCIS simultaneously).
*   **Chat Session Logic:**
    *   **ChatSession:** Stores session metadata (title, language).
    *   **ChatMessage:** Stores persistent conversation history linked to sessions.

## 🛡️ Security, Auth & Comms

* **OTP-Based Verification:** High-security 2-step verification for all registrations
  and password resets, utilizing a dedicated `OTP` model with automatic expiration.
* **Identity Verification Gate:** A mandatory account existence check is performed
  before any password reset OTP is issued. This identifies unauthorized attempts
  and triggers high-visibility security alerts for invalid users.
* **Strict Password Policy:** Validates all credentials against a high-entropy regex:
  * `minLength: 8`
  * `requirements: [Uppercase, Lowercase, Number, Special Character]`
* **Google OAuth 2.0:** Secure, one-click social login via Passport.js configuration.
* **JWT Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens are used for stateless, secure session management
  post-login.
* **Rate Limiting:** `express-rate-limit` acts as DDOS protection to prevent API abuse and
  guard AI processing routes.
* **SMTP & Gmail:** We use `nodemailer` configured with a production **Gmail SMTP** server for real-world delivery of **OTPs** and transactional alerts.
* **Zero-Storage Protocol:** Temporary file storage via Multer with mandatory deletion in
  `finally` blocks.
* **Admin Data Control (Dev Phase):** Administrators can remove user accounts via a
  high-security deletion bridge. This includes warning screens referencing data removal
  compliance with privacy standards (IT Act 2000).
