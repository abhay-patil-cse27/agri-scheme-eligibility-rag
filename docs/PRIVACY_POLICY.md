# Niti Setu: Data Privacy & Security Policy

Niti Setu is committed to the highest standards of data protection, aligning with the **Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act** of India.

## 1. Data Minimization & Collection
We only collect data strictly necessary for determining agricultural scheme eligibility.
*   **Aadhaar/IDs:** We DO NOT store Aadhaar numbers or ID images.
*   **Agri-Data:** We store land holding size, state, and crop types to improve accuracy.

## 2. Ephemeral Processing (Zero-Storage Policy)
Our scanning engine uses an ephemeral binary stream protocol:
1.  User uploads a document.
2.  System reads document into memory buffer.
3.  Vision AI extracts non-PII attributes.
4.  **File is immediately deleted** from server storage (`fs.unlink`).
5.  No permanent copy of your identity document remains on our servers.

## 3. Security Measures
*   **Encryption:** Data is encrypted in transit using Bank-grade TLS/SSL.
*   **JWT Authentication:** All private data access is protected by JSON Web Tokens with 30-day expiration.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Protects against automated scrapers and brute-force attacks.
*   **Audit Logging:** Admin actions (like uploading or deleting schemes) are logged for accountability.

## 4. AI Ethics & Transparency
*   **No Hallucinations:** Our RAG engine is restricted to official government documents only.
*   **Verifiable Proof:** Every AI decision includes a direct quote and page reference from the official PDF.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** AI helps you find schemes, but final applications are processed on official `gov.in` portals.

## 5. Your Rights
*   **Right to Erasure:** You can delete your farmer profile and all associated eligibility history at any time.
*   **Right to Access:** You can view all data stored about you in the "Settings" page.
